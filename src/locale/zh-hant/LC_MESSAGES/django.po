"Citizen science actively involves the public in scientific research that "

"bring together science, policy makers, and society as a whole in an "
"impactful way. As a core dimension of Open Science, it opens up the "
"opportunity for all members of society to take an active role in research, "
"innovation and the development of evidence-based policy, at local, national "
"and EU levels. Citizen scientists can participate in many stages of the "
"scientific process, from data collection and volunteer mapping, through data "

"Citizen science is a flexible concept which can be adapted and applied "
